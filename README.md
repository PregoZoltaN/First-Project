# First-Project
My name is Zoltán and I am studying to be a software developer. After many years, I change profession. I’ve always been interested in the subject, but now I have decided to take steps to achieve my goals. I accept all help in addition to self-studying and attending a course. Now I learn Git use. If anyone know more information, you can describe it here for my project.
